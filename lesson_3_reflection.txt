When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you worked on the project from more than one location or if other people
    need to access it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So you don't overwrite or lose track of changes you may have been working
    on in your local directory.  If you pull manually then you have control
    on when you pull it from the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is when you want a copy of another repository on Github that you can
    put a copy of in your own account, then you can make your changes to that
    copy.  Clone is when you make an exact copy of a repository on your GitHub
    account to your local machine or vice versa.  and Branch is when you start
    another version within a repository on GitHub or on your local machine.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    so you would have a starting point if you need to do a merge with changes
    another user has made.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You would either have to email modified files or ftp file to and from a
    server.  The easy would be you have control over your own file that you have,
    but the harder would be not being able to easily find the differences in
    a file and the really harder would not being able to collaborate with other
    programmers on the fly in almost real time to be effective.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
